      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-of-event&#34;&gt;Background of Event&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was the first in-person CTF challenge I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done. While I was tempted to stay the full 24 hours, I unfortunately couldn&amp;rsquo;t. It was quite a fun event, even though I only really solved three challenges. The challenges themselves were ranging in difficulty, and there was a wide spread of challenges. These challenges make you think, and try to find other avenues for solving a problem. Think you&amp;rsquo;ve got a solution? Think some more. There were layers to the challenges, which made them engaging and worthwhile to actually stick with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
